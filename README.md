# Ada bindings for PLplot
This is a copy of the `bindings/ada` directory from [plplot](http://plplot.sourceforge.net/), with Alire and gprbuild metadata added. This package will link against your host system's libplplot. On Debian bullseye, this is as simple as `apt install libplplot17`. Other versions may work, I haven't tested that.

These sources were copied from git://git.code.sf.net/p/plplot/plplot commit 95bf7ebfe56154dda5fd4301a3ab7927848a7623
